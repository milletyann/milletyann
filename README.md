### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yann and I'm a computer science student at Telecom SudParis (Polytechnical Institute of Paris).
I am looking towards a specialization in Artificial Intelligence but I like to code sometimes. I will try to upload some projects on here since it is a bit empty at the moment ^^.
